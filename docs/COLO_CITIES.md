## Usage

The colo mapping is used in the worker to enrich responses with city names:

```typescript
import { getColoCity } from './coloMapping';

const colo = request.cf?.colo;
const coloCity = getColoCity(colo);
```

This mapping is displayed in the UI results table in the "City" column next to the "Colo" column.
